## Development History
<h4>Milestone 1</h4>
Our goal for Milestone 1 was to create a team contract and negotiate what roles and tasks each team member would be assigned. We then created a simple UI for the landing, input, sign in, and dashboard page. In addition, we decided to use the Next.js template for our project. Since we still have a few issues still in our To-Do and In-Progress tab of our M1 project board, we plan to backlog and move those issues to our M2 milestone. 

Milestone 1 was managed using [Mixed-Plate GitHub Project Board M1](https://github.com/orgs/mixed-plate/projects/2)

<h4>Milestone 2: Customer Milestone 1</h4>
Our goal for Milestone 2 was to improve our existing UI and set up a way to input the audited balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents. We also created acceptance testing for our project. In addition, we reviewed different files and code to determine what needed to be updated or removed.

<h4>Milestone 3</h4>
Our goal for Milestone 3 was to create a simple mock up for the forms page while removing any default values for the budget and audited data. We also continued to add any missing items into the audited balance sheet database. Lastly, we implemented continuous integration for our project which provides a badge that displays our project's build status.

<h4>Milestone 4: Customer Milestone 2</h4>
Our goal for Milestone 4 was to add more roles to our project and assigning certain functions for the different roles. We wanted to heavily improve the audited balance sheet by implementing a total feature for each category and fix the UI of the form to match the original spreadsheet look. We then created an admin panel and improved the UI for the home page. Along with all of this, we continued to review different files to see what needed to be updated.

<h4>Milestone 5</h4>
Our goal for Milestone 5 was to fix a bunch of our existing code and clean most of it up. We fixed the audited data UI and the format of the budget sheet so that it matched the look of the original spreadsheet. We then created a mockup pages for the audited data format and also for a CSV page. The CSV page allows authorized users to upload CSV files and have it input the data for them.
