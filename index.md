## Overview
Our objective is to develop a user-friendly website that gives clients the ability to input their financial information securely. The website will then utilize the company's proprietary algorithms and equations to analyze this data, providing clients with personalized insights and recommendations to support informed financial decision-making. The goal of the website is to assist clients in planning their financial future by offering tailored advice and foresights based on their unique financial profiles. Ultimately, this website aims to enhance client engagement, streamline and visualize the financial planning process, and deliver actionable insights that drive better financial outcomes.

## Development History
<h4>Milestone 1: Mock up Development</h4>
Our goal for Milestone 1 was to create a team contract and negotiate what roles and tasks each team member would be assigned. We then created a simple UI for the landing, input, sign in, and dashboard page. In addition, we decided to use the Next.js template for our project. 
Since we still have a few issues still in our To-Do and In-Progress tab of our M1 project board, we plan to backlog and move those issues to our M2 milestone. 

Milestone 1 was managed using [Mixed-Plate GitHub Project Board M1](https://github.com/orgs/mixed-plate/projects/2)
